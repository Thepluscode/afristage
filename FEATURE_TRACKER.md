# AfriStage — Feature Tracker

Lifecycle: `PLANNED` → `IN PROGRESS` → `DEPLOYED` → `VERIFIED`.
`VERIFIED` requires production evidence (logs, API response, observable behavior),
not just "build/tests passed". Tests passing = `DEPLOYED`.

Monorepo: NestJS+Prisma API (`apps/api`), Next.js admin (`apps/admin-web`),
Flutter mobile (`apps/mobile`).

## Session 2026-06-24 → 2026-06-25 — design replication, then defect hunt

### Mobile interface replication (from `apps/mobile/design/` mockups)

| Feature | Status | Evidence | PR |
|---------|--------|----------|----|
| Feed / room / wallet / creator dashboard to mockup fidelity | DEPLOYED | `design-qa.md` = passed; on-device captures match references | #16 |
| Profile tab stat strip (Coins · Available USD · Account) | DEPLOYED | analyze clean, widget test | #17 |
| Transaction history: readable fiat/coin amounts + dates | DEPLOYED | unit tests `ledgerMoney`/`shortDateTime` across COIN/NGN/USD/GHS | #18 |
| Notifications: type-based icons + timestamps | DEPLOYED | unit test for type→style mapping | #19 |
| Payout history: readable fiat + dates | DEPLOYED | reuses tested helpers | #20 |
| Search: category browse on initial state | DEPLOYED | widget test; `?category=` verified server-side | #21 |
| Register: brand consistency with login | DEPLOYED | analyze clean | #22 |
| Onboarding: Creator intent routes into apply flow | DEPLOYED | analyze clean | #23 |
| Creator room performance: show date | DEPLOYED | reuses tested helper | #24 |
| Support ticket: message timestamps | DEPLOYED | reuses tested helper | #25 |
| Add payout method: client-side validation | DEPLOYED | unit test `payoutMethodError` | #26 |
| Support hub: feedback on empty submit | DEPLOYED | analyze clean | #27 |
| Accessibility: screen-reader labels on image-only controls | DEPLOYED | 2 semantics-tree widget tests | #28 |

### Defect hunt (adversarial money/async/silent-failure audit)

| Fix | Severity | Status | Evidence | PR |
|-----|----------|--------|----------|----|
| Coin **double-spend / overdraw race** — non-atomic balance check + debit; concurrent gifts/payouts (distinct idempotency keys) could mint coins / over-reserve payouts. Fixed with `FOR UPDATE` lock + in-transaction balance assertion (`guardNonNegative`). Gift `quantity` bounded `@Max(10000)`. | CRITICAL | DEPLOYED | new overdraw/covered-debit tests; API 152/152 | #29 |
| Coin overdraw fix — **real-DB concurrency test**: 20 parallel gifts on a 1000-coin wallet → exactly 10 win, balance lands at 0, never negative. Proven to have teeth (removing the guard → 20 win, −1000). | — | DEPLOYED | `npm run test:concurrency` 1/1; excluded from default suite | #34 |
| API **silent failures** — `.catch(()=>{})` dropped watch-time + peak-viewer writes; cron with no try/catch leaked zombie LIVE rooms. Now logged. | HIGH | DEPLOYED | tsc clean, chat+live-rooms 27/27 | #30 |
| Mobile **reconnect-banner bug** ("Chat rejoined" on first connect) + swallowed auth-refresh / wallet-load errors now logged. | HIGH/MED | DEPLOYED | analyze clean, mobile 18/18 | #31 |
| Schema note: `GiftTransaction.*Minor` fields hold **COINS** not fiat (immunize against a future wrong `/100` "fix"). | DOC | DEPLOYED | comment-only; `migrate diff` empty | #32 |

**False positives caught by verification (NOT changed):**
- `usd(wallet.earningBalance)` "shows 100×" — `earningBalance` is COIN; `usd()` maps 1 coin ≈ $1 by design (`wallet.service.ts:53`).
- `creatorEarningMinor` "is minor fiat" — it's whole coins; never divided by 100 anywhere; "X coins" display is correct.

## Verification debt

These are `DEPLOYED` (tests/build pass) but **not yet `VERIFIED`** in production
(no prod logs / live evidence):

- All of the above — verified locally (host-GPU emulator captures, jest/flutter
  suites), not against a deployed environment. GitHub Actions is billing-blocked,
  so CI evidence is unavailable; merges rest on local green.
- The coin-overdraw fix (#29) relies on Postgres row locks under real concurrency.
  ✅ Now covered by a real-DB concurrency test (#34) — proven under 20 parallel
  gifts on a local Postgres, with teeth verified (guard removed → overdraw). The
  remaining gap to `VERIFIED` is the same as everything else: evidence from a
  deployed prod/staging environment, not just local.

## Notes

- Test runner for `apps/api` is **jest** (not vitest, despite some docs).
- Run: `cd apps/api && npm test` · `cd apps/mobile && flutter test`.
